        To format a plain text file for the \"Learn my lines\" application, the app\'s intelligent parser expects a simple, structured layout that clearly delineates the play\'s title, acts, scenes, characters, and their dialogue.\n\n
        Here\'s a short description of the expected format:\n\n
        • File Type: The file should be a plain text file (e.g., .txt).\n
        • Play Title: The play\'s title should be on the first line, prefixed with a single # (e.g., # My Wonderful Play).\n
        • Acts: Indicate a new act by starting a line with ## followed by its name (e.g., ## Act 1).\n
        • Scenes: Indicate a new scene by starting a line with ### followed by its name (e.g., ### Scene 1). Scenes should be nested within acts.\n
        • Character Lines: Each character\'s dialogue should begin with the character\'s name, followed by a colon, and then their line. The line can\'t span multiple physical lines in the file. Empty lines are ignored.\n
        • Stage Directions: Indicate stage directions with parenthesis. If you have stage directions that appear between lines of dialogue, they will be added to the beginning of the following line.\n\n
